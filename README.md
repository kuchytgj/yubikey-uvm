UVM toolchain to manage YubiKeys within our Duo Security account

==Overview==
This project is for a web interface intended to be run on a small embedded or micro computer (i.e. CuBox, Raspberry Pi, etc). The web interface interacts with the local system via asynchronous HTTP calls to a CGI script that can read and write to the USB bus and therefore YubiKey devices.
